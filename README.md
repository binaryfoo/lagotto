[ ![Codeship Status for binaryfoo/lagotto](https://codeship.com/projects/90b68e60-780c-0132-6736-4ab0787fdfaa/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/55597)

A library to parse, filter and output XML logs written by [jPOS](http://jpos.org).

Can be used:

  * From a shell as a fat .jar (see the shell script [lago](https://github.com/binaryfoo/jpos-logs-scala/blob/master/lago)).
  * From adhoc code. See [examples](https://github.com/binaryfoo/lagotto/tree/master/src/main/scala/io/github/binaryfoo/lagotto/examples).
  * One day? From Apache Spark.

Use it now by downloading the command line interface fat .jar from the [releases](https://github.com/binaryfoo/lagotto/releases) page.

See the --help output for a rough idea [usage.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binaryfoo/lagotto/master/usage.txt) of what it can do. More examples are needed.
