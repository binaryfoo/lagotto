== Filters

Use these with the filters: -f and --field.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Example
|Description

|mti=0200
|Field 0 (MTI) is 0200

|mti!=0200
|Field 0 (MTI) is anything other than 0200

|39!=
|Field 39 is not empty

|rtt>500
|Round trip time (available with --pair) is greater than or equal to 500ms

|11<123456
|STAN is less than or equal to 123456

|48~magic
|Field 48 contains magic (case sensitive)

|mti~/08[0-3]0/
|Field 0 (MTI) matches the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[regular expression] 08[0-3]0.
|===

If you specify multiple filters only records that match all filters will be returned.

To match one thing or another you can use a regex like 48~/(one thing)|(or another)/. A little contrived but it works for now.

== Field Expressions

Use these with the table output formats: --ascii, --csv, --tsv --utf, --html and the live variants (--live-html, --live-ascii, --live-utf).

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Example
|Description

|0
|Field 0 (the MTI) from a jPOS <log> entry. Aliased by mti.

|48.3.2.1
|A quite deeply nested subfield

|field(/regex/$1/)
|Apply the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[regular expression] to the value of field. Ouput the replacement. A bit like sed but with Java's regex flavour.
|===

=== jPOS

In a jPOS log entry a bunch of fields are exposed. For example:

    <log realm="some.channel/10.0.0.1:4321" at="Mon Nov 24 01:31:59 EST 2014.292" lifespan="10005ms">
      <receive>
        <isomsg direction="incoming">
          <!-- org.jpos.iso.packager.XMLPackager -->
          <field id="0" value="0800"/>
          <field id="7" value="1124000003"/>
          <field id="11" value="28928"/>
          <isomsg id="48">
            <field id="1" value="nested subfield"/>
          </isomsg>
        </isomsg>
      </receive>
    </log>

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Value in example

|realm
|some.channel/10.0.0.1:4321

|ipAddress
|10.0.0.1

|socket
|10.0.0.1:4321

|link
|some.channel

|timestamp
|2014-11-08 01:31:59.292

|lifespan
|10005

|0
|0800

|mti
|0800

|48.1
|nested subfield

|msgType
|receive

|===

Some extra derived fields are available too.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Value in example

|icon
|<-

|summary
|<- 0800 (Network Management Request)

|length(48.1)
|15

|===

=== log4j

In a log record like `[08 Nov 2014 13:54:59,001] INFO  [a.ClassName]: Did something useful` the following fields are available.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Value in example

|timestamp
|2014-11-08 13:54:59.001

|level
|INFO

|category
|a.ClassName

|message
|Did something useful

|===

If the log4j record contains a jPOS message, like the following example, all the usual jPOS fields are available.
If there is a name collision, the value from the jPOS entry is available with the prefix `jpos.`. For example `timestamp` and `jpos.timestamp` in the following example.

    [08 Nov 2014 01:00:20,529] ERROR [some.package]: <log realm="some.channel/172.0.1.7:4779" at="Sat Nov 08 01:00:21 EST 2014.001" lifespan="290ms">
        <receive>
          <exception name="Oops">
          Oops
          </exception>
        </receive>
      </log>

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Value in example

|timestamp
|2014-11-08 01:00:20.529

|jpos.timestmap
|2014-11-08 01:00:21.001

|exception
|Oops

|realm
|some.channel/172.0.1.7:4779

|===

=== More fields available on all log types

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Description

|delay
|Milliseconds elapsed between two consecutive messages

|src
|File name and line number output row is derived from

|file
|File name output row is derived from

|line
|Line number output row is derived from

|field(/regex/replacement/)
|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Regex] replacement

|elapsed
|Time since the first log entry

|elapsedSince(filter)
|Time since the last log entry matching filter

|if(filter,trueExpr,falseExpr)
|If filter is true, show trueExpr, otherwise falseExpr. Either expression can be blank.

|distinct(field)
|Only one row per unique value of field.

|===

== Aggregation

Use count, sum, min, max, avg, group_concat, group_sample, count(condition)

Can also use distinct(). Eg group_concat(distinct(2))

group_sample(src 3) picks 3 random src values from the N values in a group

== Pairing

--pair option will match responses to requests based on MTI, STAN and realm. Only works for jPOS entries.

The following additional fields will be available to filter, aggregate and display.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Description

|request.<field>
|Value of <field> on the request. Eg request.timestamp or request.2

|req.<field>
|Same as above

|response.<field>
|Value of <field> on the response. Eg response.timestamp or resp.39

|resp.<field>
|Same as above

|rtt
|Round trip time in milliseconds: response.timestamp - request.timestamp.

|===

By default fields are looked up on the request. If not found then on the response.
Eg timestamp is the same as req.timestamp whilst 39 would typically fall through to resp.39 as 39 is typically a response field.

== Input Formats

By default the input type is sniffed (automagically detected) by looking at the start of each line. jPOS and log4j entries are detected.

Other formats can be explicitly specified with --in-format.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Format
|Description

|csv
|Comma separated values. The field names are taken from the first row: the header.

|icsv
|Comma separated values without a header row. Fields are numbered starting at zero rather than named.

|tsv
|Tab separated values. The field names are taken from the first row: the header.

|gc
|Java Garbage Collection log output. Quite brittle depending on the JVM and version.

|apache
|Apache access logs.

|===

== Output Formats

By default the same text that's input: just act as a filter not an aggregator or formatter.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Flag
| Example
| Format

| --csv
| --csv mti,nmic,count
| Comma separated field values

| --tsv
| --tsv mti,nmic,count
| Tab separated field values

| --html
| --html time,summary,src
| HTML table

| --ascii
| --ascii exception,count
| ASCII 'art' table. Like mysql client.

| --utf
| --utf time,summary,src
| Same as --ascii but uses characters that might not print on your terminal.

| --jira-table
| --jira-table exception,count
| Table that can be pasted into jira

| --digest
| No value required
| Slightly shorter. Nesting compacted to one line.

| --json
| No value required
| A single line of JSON per input record.

| --sqlIn
| --sqlIn distinct(ipAddress)
| A list of values that can be used in a SQL IN clause.
|===

There are also --live-html, --live-utf and --live-html versions that spit out the results incrementally (as they are discovered) rather than waiting until all field widths are known.

== Others

--names to add a name attribute to each <field> element

--ui to open the results in a browser

--merge to remove duplicates when reading partially overlapping files
